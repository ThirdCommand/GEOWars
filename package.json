  "description": "GEOWars was inspired by games like Galaga, Asteroids, and Geometry Wars. The game can be played  with a keyboard or a controller. The player controls a ship moving inside an arena where enemy shapes appear. The goal is to shoot down as many of these enemies as possible without getting hit  by an enemy shape. When enemies are shot, they explode with vibrant color particle effects making the  game visually spicy.",
